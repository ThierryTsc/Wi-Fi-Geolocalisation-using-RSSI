# Wi-Fi-Geolocalisation-using-RSSI
This project applies Wi-Fi-based geolocation using RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) maps. A neural network is trained to predict the (x, y) position of a device based on signal strength measurements from multiple Wi-Fi access points. The model is evaluated using the RÂ² score and distance error analysis.
